Habit Tracker Application Documentation
Instruction: focus on phase#1 feature first, leave phase#2 to next version
1. Introduction
The Habit Tracker application is designed to help users build and maintain positive habits through visual tracking, gamification, and consistent logging. Its unique visual feedback system uses animated "demon balls" that accumulate as users log habit completions, providing an engaging and motivating interface.
2. Core Features
2.1 Habit Management
Create habits: Users can create custom habits with names, avatars
Edit habits: Modify existing habits' details
Delete habits: Remove unwanted habits from tracking
2.2 Habit Tracking
Check-in/log completions: Mark habits as completed for today(canâ€™t add log for day other than today)
Add logs (texutal input)
List view: Visualize the log as a list in this day - log
Monthly view: View the log by month
Calendar navigation: Jump between different months from a selector at the top of the interface
2.3 Statistics and Analytics 
Completion rate: Track number of logs this month
Streak analytics: Record longest streaks and current streaks
Progress charts: Visualize improvement over time
Insights: Generate observations about habit patterns and success rates
2.4 Background Visual Feedback System // SKIP for now
Demon ball accumulation: Each habit completion adds a demon ball to the collection
Physics-based animation: Balls react to device movement with realistic physics
Ball customization: Different colors or styles for different habit categories
Shake interaction: Shake device to make balls move and interact
2.5 Reminder System //skip
Notification settings: Customize when and how to receive reminders
Smart reminders: Adaptive reminders based on user behavior patterns
Gentle nudges: Non-intrusive reminders during user-defined active hours
4. Technical Architecture
